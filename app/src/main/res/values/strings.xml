    <string name="faq">FAQ</string>
    <string name="faq_how_does_the_app_work" formatted="false">Question: How does the app work?\nAnswer: Residual capacity is formed on the basis of the current capacity upon reaching 100% and the status of \"Charged\". The current capacity is taken from the kernel of the OS, by the Android API itself, which allows you to get the current capacity without root rights. The kernel takes the current capacity from the battery itself and writes it to the \"charge_counter\" file (file path: /sys/class/power_supply/battery). On how accurate the current capacity depends on the battery and the kernel itself.\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_capacity_added">Question: What is considered to be \"Capacity Added\"?\nAnswer: \"Capacity Added\" is considered very simple: the current capacity - capacity, which was before you connected the charging.\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_where_does_the_app_get_the_ccl">Question: Where does the application get the \"Charging Current Limit\"?\nAnswer: The application takes the \"Charging Current Limit\" from the kernel file \"constant_charge_current_max\" along the path /sys/class/power_supply/battery.\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_why_is_ccl_not_displayed">Question: Why is \"Charging Current Limit\" not displayed?\nAnswer: The display \"Charging Current Limit\" depends on whether the file \"constant_charge_current_max\" is readable or not. Not all kernels allow \"reading\" this file, and also not all kernels have this file.\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_i_have_everything_in_zeros" formatted="false">Question: I have everything (or almost everything) in zeros. Why?\nAnswer: Because the manufacturer of your device has saved on various sensors.  And since the kernel cannot get the value, it returns 0.\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_units">Question: Very large or small numbers are shown in the current capacity, charge/discharge current, voltage.\nAnswer: Go to the settings, in the \"Misc\" section, expand all the settings and change the unit of measurement.\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_current_capacity">Question: The current capacity has ceased to be displayed, although it was previously displayed (or is displayed, but not always).\nAnswer: This means that the battery is coming or has already come to an end. If everything is in order with the battery, then the firmware kernel or the controller, which gives the current capacity, may be buggy.\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_residual_capacity_is_higher" formatted="false">Question: Residual capacity is higher than the design capacity\nAnswer: If the battery is new, this is normal. The capacity of a battery, especially a new one, is never equal to the design capacity, it is either 2–3% less, or higher, but most often lower. If the capacity of the new battery is higher than the design one, then consider yourself lucky with the battery. If the battery is not new, you can try to calibrate the kernel by discharging the battery to 10% or lower and charging it to full 100%. If this does not help, then unfortunately either the kernel developers made a mistake somewhere that incorrectly reads the current capacity from the battery, or the matter is in the battery itself\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_battery_wear_changes_when_charger_is_disconnected">Question: Battery wear changes when the charger is disconnected\nAnswer: The fact is that when the charger is disconnected, sometimes the current capacity differs from what it was when fully charged, thus, when the charger is disconnected, the battery wear is more true than before the charger was disconnected\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_battery_wear_not_change" formatted="false">Question: Battery wear does not change even after several months\nAnswer: Sometimes the current capacity may not be displayed correctly and due to this the battery wear will be incorrect. In order to avoid this, calibrate the current capacity once a month or two. In order to calibrate the current capacity, you need to discharge the battery to 10% or lower and charge to 100% (status: \"Fully Charged\")\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_with_each_charge_battery_wear_changes">Question: With each charge, the battery wear changes, then increases, then decreases\nAnswer: This is normal, since chemical processes occur in the battery\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_where_does_the_app_get_the_number_of_cycles_android">Question: Where does the application get the \"Number of Cycles (Android)\"?\nAnswer: The application gets data from the \"cycles_count\" kernel file at the path: /sys/class/power_supply/battery\n\n</string>
    <string name="faq_not_displayed_number_of_cycles_android">Question: Not Displayed \"Number of Cycles (Android)\"\nAnswer: If \"Number of Cycles (Android)\" is not displayed, then it is not possible to read the file in which the number of charging cycles is recorded due to the fact that read access is closed\n\n</string>

If you use the device with a fully charged battery when the charger is connected, then 2 things happen - heating, which negatively affects the battery life and frequent recharging, which reduces the number of cycles.</string>
